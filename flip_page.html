						<p class='artist'>
       						In my opinion, H.E.R. is one of the most talented musicians of my generation. Her vocal range is insanely large, and ths songs she writes showcase her voice amazingly. I also love the message behind her stage name H.E.R., which represents how she wants to maintain her personal life outside of music, and wants her life in music to simply be encapsulated by the name H.E.R.

				Lizzy McAlpine
			</p>
			<p class='artist'>
       		Lizzy McAlpine's songs are all about the lyrics. From songs like "To the Mountains" that are about independence to "Apple Pie" which is about finding a sense of home in the person you love, her songs cover a range of emotions. The songs Lizzy McAlpine writes stand out from songs I've heard from any other artist, making her truly one of my all-time favorite artists.

				Fleetwood Mac
			</p>
			<p class='artist'>
        	Fleetwood Mac's music has been a constant factor throughout my life. Songs like Landslide, Dreams, and The Chain were staples in my house growing up, and were favorites among many of my closest childhood friends as well. I am yet to find a modern-day band who captures the essence of Fleetwood Mac, and I find myself coming back to their music time and time again.

				6lack
			</p>
			<p class='artist'>
        	Sometimes I find that the R&B genre of music can be repetitive, but 6lack is a clear exception. The melodies in his songs are beautiful, and the messages he communicates with his lyrics seem to somehow always resonate with me. I've been a big fan of his for the last 5 years or so, and I've loved watching his growth as an artist in that time.

				The Rolling Stones
			</p>
			<p class='artist'>
        	The Rolling Stones hold a special place in my heart because my entire family listens to them. From my grandparents to  my parents to my aunts and uncles to my cousins, all of us have a shared love of this band. Growing up, songs like "Beast of Burden" were a staple at family functions, making them as a band stand out as a clear favorite of mine.

				J. Cole
			</p>
			<p class='artist'>
        	J. Cole is by far my favorite rapper. I find that a lot of mainstream rappers have lost their style over time as they have become more mainstream, and in my opinion, J. Cole has done a great job maintaining his own signature style throughout his rise to prominence. From his days of releasing E.P.'s on Soundcloud to now, his lyrics have been emotional and deep and his production style has been intricate yet balanced. I could rave about my love for him as an artist endlessly.
